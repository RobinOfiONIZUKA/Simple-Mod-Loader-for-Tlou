Tlou Mod Loader: Enhance Your Last of Us Experience with Custom Scripts

Welcome to Tlou Mod Loader, a versatile script loader designed exclusively for The Last of Us game. This lightweight program allows you to effortlessly load and activate custom scripts (DLL files) that will take your gaming experience to the next level.

Before we begin, please ensure that you have administrative privileges on your computer. Admin rights are essential for the smooth functioning of the Mod Loader.

Once you launch the program, a user-friendly console interface will greet you, displaying the Mod Loader's title and a warm welcome message.

To get started, make sure you have a file named "Config.ini" in the same directory as the Mod Loader. This file should contain the path to The Last of Us game installation.

Next, ensure that you have a directory called "Scripts" located in the same location as the Mod Loader. This directory will serve as the repository for all your custom script files (DLLs). If the Scripts directory is missing, you can easily create it before proceeding.

The Mod Loader will now load the list of scripts from the "scripthook.ini" file. If this file doesn't exist, no worries! The Mod Loader will create it for you. The ini file allows you to enable or disable individual scripts by adjusting the corresponding settings.

In addition to the ini file, the Mod Loader will scan the Scripts directory for any new DLL files that are not listed. It will automatically add these files to the script list and enable them by default. You have complete control over which scripts get activated.

Once the script loading process is complete, the Mod Loader will seamlessly launch The Last of Us game using the Steam protocol. You will receive a message indicating that the game is launching.

Please be patient while the Mod Loader waits for the game process to start. As soon as the game is detected, the Mod Loader will begin injecting the enabled scripts into the game.

If any errors occur during the injection process, the Mod Loader will promptly display an error message for each affected script. On the other hand, successful injections will be acknowledged with a corresponding success message.

In case no scripts are activated, the Mod Loader will count the number of available scripts and provide you with the count for your convenience.

To enhance your gaming experience even further, the Mod Loader seamlessly integrates with Discord Rich Presence. This exciting feature displays a presence status on Discord, revealing the number of loaded scripts currently enhancing your Last of Us gameplay.

To exit the program and gracefully close the game, simply press the Enter key. The Mod Loader will ensure a smooth termination of the game process and subsequently shut down.

Now, get ready to embark on an incredible journey through The Last of Us, equipped with the added functionality and versatility provided by Tlou Mod Loader. Let the adventure begin!
