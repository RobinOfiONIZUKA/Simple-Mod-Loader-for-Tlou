Tlou Mod Loader: A Convenient Script Loader for The Last of Us

Welcome to Tlou Mod Loader, a lightweight script loader designed specifically for The Last of Us game. With this program, you can easily load and activate custom scripts (DLL files) to enhance your gaming experience.

Before we begin, please ensure that you have administrative privileges on your computer. This is necessary for the Mod Loader to function properly.

Once you have launched the program, see a console interface displaying the program's title and a welcoming message.

To proceed, make sure you have a file named "Config.ini" in the same directory as the Mod Loader. This file should contain the path to The Last of Us game.

Next, ensure that you have a directory named "Scripts" in the same location as the Mod Loader. This directory will hold all your custom script files (DLLs). If the Scripts directory is missing, please create it before continuing.

The Mod Loader will now load the list of scripts from the "scripthook.ini" file. If this file doesn't exist, don't worry! The Mod Loader will create it for you. The ini file allows you to enable or disable individual scripts by modifying the corresponding settings.

In addition, the Mod Loader will scan the Scripts directory for any new DLL files that are not listed in the ini file. It will automatically add them to the script list and set them to be enabled by default. You have full control over which scripts are activated.

Once the script loading process is complete, the Mod Loader will open The Last of Us game using the Steam protocol. You will see a message indicating that the game is launching.

Please be patient while the Mod Loader waits for the game process to start. Once the game is detected, the Mod Loader will begin injecting the enabled scripts into the game.

If any errors occur during the injection process, the Mod Loader will display an error message for each affected script. Otherwise, it will show a success message for each injected script.

If no scripts are activated, the Mod Loader will count the number of available scripts and display the count for your reference.

To enhance your gaming experience even further, the Mod Loader integrates with Discord Rich Presence. This feature displays a presence status on Discord, showing the number of loaded scripts in The Last of Us.

To exit the program and close the game, simply press the Enter key. The Mod Loader will gracefully terminate the game process and shut down.

Enjoy exploring The Last of Us with the added functionality and versatility provided by Tlou Mod Loader. Have fun gaming!
